SpeakToCure is a public kiosk-based healthcare assistant that enables rural citizens to access preliminary health diagnosis by simply speaking their symptoms in their native language.
The system analyzes the spoken input, suggests probable diseases, and connects the user to nearby specialized doctors â€” without the need for smartphones, literacy, or technical skills.

Built specifically for rural India, especially the North-Eastern region, SpeakToCure addresses digital divide, language barriers, and healthcare inaccessibility through voice-first technology.
